/** @file timer.h
 *  Defines stuff related to the timer.
 *
 *  Basically, it starts a timer, stops it and returns the delta between
 *  them in several time units.
 *
 *  @note If both timer_start() and timer_stop() don't get called
 *        before any timer_delta_*() function, the results are unpredictable.
 *
 *  This module uses gettimeofday().
 *  It is Unix, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X system-specific.
 *  The only portable function is time.h's clock(), but it isn't very precise.
 *  See: http://www.songho.ca/misc/timer/timer.html
